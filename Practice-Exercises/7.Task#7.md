# Reverse Integer

Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.

Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).


```
| # | Input  | Output |
|---|--------|--------|
| 1 | x=123  | 321    |
| 2 | x=-123 | -321   |
| 3 | x=123  | 21     |

```

Input: x = 120
Output: 21
