# BASIC CSS SELECTORS <a name = 'basic-css-selectors'></a>
```css
.selector
{
    property:value
}
```
 A CSS selector is used to select and match HTML elements in a web page, and then apply styles to those elements. There are many different types of selectors, ranging from simple element selectors to more complex attribute selectors and pseudo-class selectors.
```css
.class-name 
{
  color: blue;
  font-size: 16px;
}

```
For example, in the CSS code above, **.class-name** is a class selector that selects all elements with the class "class-name". The styles inside the curly braces will then be applied to those selected elements.
Other common types of selectors include element selectors, ID selectors, and attribute selectors. With these selectors, you can select HTML elements based on their tag name, their ID attribute, or their other attributes, respectively.

It's important to note that CSS selectors can also be combined to create more specific and targeted styles. For example, you can use a combination of a class selector and an element selector to select only specific elements with a particular class.
<br><br>

## 1. Universal Selector <a name = '1.universal-selector'></a>
The universal selector, which is merely a *, chooses everything as its name implies. The code below would make all elements on the page's padding to 16px.

```css
* 
{
  padding: 16px;
}
```
This selector is ideal for making significant changes to your entire page, such as changing box sizes or deleting margins, but it is rarely used for other purposes.
<br><br>

## 2. Class Selector <a name = '2.class-selector'></a>
A CSS class selector is used to select elements with a specific class attribute value. The class selector starts with a period (.) followed by the class name. Here's an example:

```css
.btn-class 
{
  color: blue;
  font-size: 16px;
}
```

In this btn, the class selector **.btn-class** selects all elements with the class "btn-class". The styles inside the curly braces will then be applied to those selected elements.

To apply a class to an HTML element, you simply add the class attribute to the element with the desired class name as its value, like this:

```html
<p class="btn-class">This is some text.</p>
```
Multiple classes can be added to a single element by separating the class names with a space:

```html
<p class="btn-class another-btn-class">This is some text.</p>
```
In this example, the styles associated with both the .btn-class and .another-btn-class selectors will be applied to the element.
<br><br>

## 3. ID Selector <a name = '3.id-selector'></a>

A CSS ID selector is used to select a specific element based on its unique ID attribute value. The ID selector starts with a hash symbol (#) followed by the ID name. Here's an example:

#example-id {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 16px;
}
In this example, the ID selector #example-id selects the element with the ID "example-id". The styles inside the curly braces will then be applied to that selected element.

To apply an ID to an HTML element, you simply add the ID attribute to the element with the desired ID name as its value, like this:

```html
<p id="example-id">This is some text.</p>
```
It's important to note that IDs must be unique within a single HTML document. This means that no two elements can have the same ID. IDs are typically used when you want to apply styles to a specific, unique element on a page.

In CSS, the ID selector has a higher specificity than class selectors and element selectors, meaning that styles defined with an ID selector will take precedence over styles defined with class selectors or element selectors. This allows you to override styles for specific elements when necessary.

<br><br>

## 4. Type Selector <a name = '4.type-selector'></a>
A type selector, also known as an element selector, is used to select elements based on their HTML tag name. The type selector simply consists of the tag name of the element you want to select. Here's an example:

```css
p {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 16px;
}
```
In this example, the type selector p selects all <p> elements. The styles inside the curly braces will then be applied to those selected elements.

Type selectors are the most basic and straightforward way to select elements in CSS. They allow you to apply styles to all elements of a specific type, regardless of their class or ID.

For example, you can use a type selector to style all \<h1> elements on a page to be bold and larger:


```css
h1 {
  font-weight: bold;
  font-size: 20px;
}
```

It's important to note that type selectors have lower specificity than class selectors and ID selectors, meaning that styles defined with a class or ID selector will take precedence over styles defined with a type selector, if both selectors match the same element. However, type selectors are still very useful for defining general styles for elements on a page.
<br><br>

## 5. Attribute Selector <a name = '5.attribute-selector'></a>
A CSS attribute selector is used to select elements based on the value of one of their attributes. The attribute selector starts with the element name or universal selector (*), followed by square brackets that contain the attribute name and its value. Here's an example:

```css
input[type="text"] 
{
  background-color: lightgray;
  padding: 12px;
}
```
In this example, the attribute selector input[type="text"] selects all '\<input>' elements with a type attribute equal to "text". The styles inside the curly braces will then be applied to those selected elements.

Attribute selectors can also match part of an attribute value by using the *= or ^= operators. For example:

```css
a[href*="example"] 
{
  color: blue;
  text-decoration: underline;
}
```
In this example, the attribute selector a[href*="example"] selects all \<a> elements with an href attribute that contains the string "example". The styles inside the curly braces will then be applied to those selected elements.

Attribute selectors are useful for applying styles to elements based on the values of their attributes, rather than their class or ID. They can also be used to target specific elements in a more targeted and efficient manner, as compared to class or ID selectors.

# COMBINATION CSS SELECTORS <a name = 'combination-css-selector'></a>

Combination selectors are used to select elements based on multiple criteria, such as their tag name, class, or ID, as well as their attributes or the relationship between elements.

Here are some examples of combination selectors:
<br><br>
## 6. Descendant Selector <a name = '6.descendant-selector'></a>
The descendant selector consists of two or more selectors separated by whitespace. It selects elements that are descendants of another element. For example:

```css
ul li {
  list-style-type: square;
}
```

In this example, the descendant selector ul li selects all \<li> elements that are descendants of a \<ul> element. The styles inside the curly braces will be applied to those selected elements.
<br><br>

## 7. Child Selector <a name = '7.child-selector'></a>
The child selector consists of two or more selectors separated by a > symbol. It selects elements that are direct children of another element. For example:

```css
ul > li {
  list-style-type: square;
}
```

In this example, the child selector ul > li selects all \<li> elements that are direct children of a \<ul> element. The styles inside the curly braces will be applied to those selected elements.
<br><br>

## 8. General Sibling Selector <a name='8.general-sibling-selector'></a>
The general sibling selector is a selector in CSS that selects elements that are siblings of another element, regardless of their position relative to each other. The general sibling selector is represented by the ~ symbol, and consists of two or more selectors separated by the ~ symbol.

Here's an example:

```css
h1 ~ p 
{
  margin-top: 0;
}
```
In this example, the general sibling selector h1 ~ p selects all \<p> elements that are siblings of an \<h1> element. The styles inside the curly braces will be applied to those selected elements.
<br><br>




## 9. Adjacent Sibling Selector <a name = '9.adjacent-sibling-selector'></a>
The adjacent sibling selector consists of two or more selectors separated by a + symbol. It selects elements that are siblings of another element and immediately follow it. For example:
```css
h1 + p {
  margin-top: 0;
}
```
```html
<h1>Heading</h1>
<p>Paragraph 1</p>
<p>Paragraph 2</p>
```
In this example, the adjacent sibling selector h1 + p selects the first \<p> element that immediately follows an \<h1> element. The styles inside the curly braces will be applied to that selected element.
<br><br>

## Difference Between Adjacent And General Sibling Selector

The difference between the general sibling selector and the adjacent sibling selector (+ symbol) is that the general sibling selector selects all siblings of an element, regardless of their position relative to each other, while the adjacent sibling selector only selects the immediately following sibling of an element.

For example, consider the following HTML:

```css
<h1>Heading</h1>
<p>Paragraph 1</p>
<p>Paragraph 2</p>
```
With the following CSS:

```css
h1 + p {
  background-color: yellow;
}

h1 ~ p {
  background-color: lightblue;
}
```

In this example, the adjacent sibling selector h1 + p would only select the first \<p> element (Paragraph 1) and apply the background-color: yellow style to it. The general sibling selector h1 ~ p, on the other hand, would select both \<p> elements (Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 2) and apply the background-color: lightblue style to both of them.

The general sibling selector is useful when you want to select all siblings of an element, regardless of their position relative to each other, and apply styles to them.
<br><br>

## 10. Or Selector <a name = '10.or-selector'></a>
```css
div, label
{
  color: red;
}
```
The aforementioned selector chooses all items that are either divs or labels. This is excellent if you want several selectors to do the same function. Simply use a comma to divide your selectors before using the or selector. In general, I divide long selectors onto distinct lines to make them easier to read.

```css
.css_long_class_name,
.css_another_class_name
{
  font-size: 12px;
}
```
<br><br>

## 11. AND Selector <a name = '11.and-selector'></a>
The AND combination selector is probably the most used combination selector. This selector allows you to write CSS selectors that force elements to match all the selectors specified.

```css
div.glow 
{
  color: red;
}
```
```html
<div class="glow">Selected</div>
<div>Not</div>
<span class="glow">Not</span>
```
**One thing to note here is theres not space in between the selectors.** As you can see only the div with the class of glow is selected in the above example. Using the and combination selector is also incredibly easy since all you have to do is write all the selectors right next to each other with no spacing between them.

The only important thing to know about this selector is that if you are using a universal selector or a type selector then you must put the type/universal selector first.
<br><br>

## 12. Class and ID Selectors <a name = '12.class-and-id-selector'></a>
Class and ID selectors can be combined to select elements that have both a specific class and ID. For example:
```css
.example-class#example-id 
{
  color: blue;
  font-size: 16px;
}
```

In this example, the combination selector .example-class#example-id selects the element that has both the class "example-class" and the ID "example-id". The styles inside the curly braces will be applied to that selected element.

Combination selectors allow you to be more specific and precise in your selections, and can help you target elements with greater accuracy. They are useful for creating complex styles that depend on the relationship between elements or the values of their attributes.
<br>
<br>

# Pseudo Elements Selectors
Pseudo-element selectors are special selectors in CSS that allow you to select and style a specific part of an element. They are prefixed with two colons ( \:\: ) and can be used to select and style the first letter, first line, before, and after of an element, among others.

Some common pseudo-elements include:

::before: Selects and styles the content that comes before the content of an element.
::after: Selects and styles the content that comes after the content of an element.
::first-letter: Selects and styles the first letter of an element's content.
::first-line: Selects and styles the first line of an element's content.
Here is an example of how you can use pseudo-elements in CSS:

```css
p::first-letter 
{
  font-size: 2em;
  font-weight: bold;
  float: left;
}
```
<br><br>

## 13. Before Pseudo Element <a name = '13.before-pseudo-element'></a>
The ::before pseudo-element is used to insert content before an element's content. It can be used to add decorative elements, such as background images or text, to an element without modifying the HTML source code.

Here is an example of how you can use the ::before pseudo-element in CSS:

```css
p::before 
{
  content: "Note: ";
  font-weight: bold;
}
```
In this example, the word "Note: " will be inserted before the content of every \<p> element and will be displayed in a bold font.

The content property is used to specify the content to be inserted. The font-weight property sets the font weight to bold.

It's important to note that the ::before pseudo-element must have a content property to display anything, otherwise it will be invisible.
<br><br>

## 14. After Pseudo Element <a name = '14.after-pseudo-element'></a>
The ::after pseudo-element is similar to the ::before pseudo-element, but it inserts content after an element's content. It can be used to add decorative elements, such as background images or text, to an element without modifying the HTML source code.

Here is an example of how you can use the ::after pseudo-element in CSS:

```css
p::after 
{
  content: " Read More";
  font-style: italic;
}
```
In this example, the text " Read More" will be inserted after the content of every \<p> element and will be displayed in an italic font.

The content property is used to specify the content to be inserted. The font-style property sets the font style to italic.

It's important to note that the ::after pseudo-element must have a content property to display anything, otherwise it will be invisible.
<br><br>

## 15. Hover Pseudo Class <a name = '15.hover-pseudo-class'></a>
The :hover pseudo-class is a selector in CSS that allows you to style an element when a user hovers over it with their mouse. It is used to create dynamic and interactive effects on a web page.

Here is an example of how you can use the :hover pseudo-class in CSS:

```css
a:hover 
{
  color: blue;
  text-decoration: underline;
}
```
In this example, when a user hovers over a link (\<a> element), the text color will change to blue and an underline will appear.

The :hover pseudo-class is often used to create rollover effects, change the background color or text color, or add a border to an element when a user hovers over it. It is supported by all major browsers and is a useful tool for creating dynamic and interactive web pages.
<br><br>

## 16. Focus Pseudo Class <a name = '16.focus-pseudo-class'></a>
The :focus pseudo-class is a selector in CSS that allows you to style an element when it has focus. When an element has focus, it is the active element that the user is interacting with, such as a form input field, a button, or a link.

Here is an example of how you can use the :focus pseudo-class in CSS:

```css
input:focus 
{
  border: 2px solid blue;
  outline: none;
}
```
In this example, when an input field has focus, a 2-pixel blue border will be added around it, and the outline will be removed (outline: none).

The :focus pseudo-class is useful for creating accessible and user-friendly forms, as it allows you to visually indicate which form element is currently being interacted with. It is supported by all major browsers and is an important tool for creating accessible web pages.
<br><br>

## 17. Checked Pseudo Class <a name = '17.checked-pseudo-class'></a>
The :checked pseudo-class is a selector in CSS that allows you to style an element when it is in a checked state. This pseudo-class is used with radio buttons and checkboxes to style the elements when they are selected.

Here is an example of how you can use the :checked pseudo-class in CSS:

```css
input[type="checkbox"]:checked + label 
{
  color: green;
}
```
In this example, when a checkbox is selected (checked), the label associated with it (selected using the adjacent sibling selector +) will change color to green.

The :checked pseudo-class is useful for creating interactive and dynamic user interfaces, such as forms, where the appearance of elements can change based on user input. It is supported by all major browsers and is an important tool for creating user-friendly web pages.
<br><br>

## 18. Disabled Pseudo Class<a name = '18.disabled-pseudo-class'></a>
The :disabled pseudo-class is a selector in CSS that allows you to style an element when it is in a disabled state. This pseudo-class is used with form elements, such as input fields and buttons, to style the elements when they are disabled and cannot be interacted with by the user.

Here is an example of how you can use the :disabled pseudo-class in CSS:

```css
input[type="text"]:disabled 
{
  background-color: lightgray;
  color: gray;
  cursor: not-allowed;
}
```
In this example, when a text input field is disabled, its background color will change to light gray and its text color will change to gray. Additionally, the cursor will change to a "not allowed" cursor to indicate that the element is disabled and cannot be interacted with.

The :disabled pseudo-class is useful for creating accessible and user-friendly forms, as it allows you to visually indicate when form elements are disabled and cannot be interacted with. It is supported by all major browsers and is an important tool for creating accessible web pages.
<br><br>

## 19. First Child Pseudo Class<a name = '19.first-child-pseudo-class'></a>
The :first-child pseudo-class is a selector in CSS that allows you to select and style the first child element of a parent element. This pseudo-class is often used to select and style the first child element differently from the other child elements.

Here is an example of how you can use the :first-child pseudo-class in CSS:

```css

ul li:first-child 
{
  font-weight: bold;
  margin-top: 0;
}
```
In this example, the first list item (\<li>) within an unordered list (\<ul>) will have bold text and no top margin.

The :first-child pseudo-class is useful for creating visual effects and for defining styles that should only apply to the first child of a parent element. It is supported by all major browsers and is a useful tool for creating dynamic and interactive web pages.
<br><br>

## 20. First of Type Pseudo Class<a name = '20.first-of-type-pseudo-class'></a>
The :first-of-type pseudo-class is a selector in CSS that allows you to select and style the first element of a specific type within a parent element. This pseudo-class is often used to select and style the first element of a specific type differently from the other elements of that type.

Here is an example of how you can use the :first-of-type pseudo-class in CSS:

```css
p:first-of-type {
  font-size: larger;
  margin-top: 0;
}
```
In this example, the first \<p> element within a parent element will have a larger font size and no top margin.

The :first-of-type pseudo-class is useful for creating visual effects and for defining styles that should only apply to the first element of a specific type within a parent element. It is supported by all major browsers and is a useful tool for creating dynamic and interactive web pages.
<br><br>

## 21. Not Pseudo Class<a name = '21.not-pseudo-class'></a>
The ":not" pseudo-class in CSS is used to select elements that do not match a specified selector. It's useful for creating exceptions to styles applied to elements.

The syntax for the ":not" pseudo-class is as follows:

``` css
:not(selector) 
{
  /* styles */
}
```
Here's an example that uses the ":not" pseudo-class to apply styles to all p elements except those with a class of highlight:

```css
p:not(.highlight) 
{
  color: gray;
}
```
In this example, all p elements will have a color of gray, except for those with a class of highlight.
<br><br>


<br>
<br>

# Attribute Selectors
Attribute selectors in CSS allow you to select and style elements based on the values of their attributes. There are several types of attribute selectors:

The [attribute] selector, also known as the "has attribute" selector, allows you to select elements that have a specific attribute, regardless of its value.

The [attribute=value] selector allows you to select elements that have a specific attribute with a specific value.

The [attribute^=value] selector allows you to select elements that have an attribute value starting with a specific value.

The [attribute$=value] selector allows you to select elements that have an attribute value ending with a specific value.

The [attribute*=value] selector allows you to select elements that have an attribute value containing a specific value.

Here is an example of how you can use attribute selectors in CSS:

```css
a[target="_blank"] 
{
  background-color: yellow;
}
```
In this example, all \<a> elements with a target attribute equal to "_blank" will have a yellow background.

Attribute selectors are a powerful tool for styling elements based on the values of their attributes. They are supported by all major browsers and are a useful tool for creating dynamic and interactive web pages.
<br><br>

## 22. Has Attribute Selector <a name = '22.has-attribute-selector'></a>
The [attribute] selector, also known as the "has attribute" selector, is a selector in CSS that allows you to select and style elements based on the presence of a specific attribute.

Here is an example of how you can use the [attribute] selector in CSS:

```css
a[target] 
{
  background-color: yellow;
}
```
In this example, all \<a> elements that have a target attribute will have a yellow background.

The [attribute] selector is useful for styling elements based on the presence of specific attributes, such as target, href, alt, etc. It is supported by all major browsers and is a useful tool for creating dynamic and interactive web pages.
<br><br>

## 23. Exact Attribute Selector <a name = '23.exact-attribute-selector'></a>
The exact attribute selector in CSS allows you to select elements based on their exact attribute value. The syntax for the exact attribute selector is as follows:

```css
element[attribute="value"] 
{
  /* styles */
}
```
Here's an example that uses the exact attribute selector to select all input elements with a type attribute equal to text:

```css
input[type="text"] 
{
  width: 50%;
  padding: 10px;
  font-size: 14px;
}
```
In this example, all input elements with a type attribute equal to text will have a width of 50%, padding of 10px, and a font-size of 14px.

Note that the exact attribute selector is case-sensitive, so input[type="Text"] would not match any elements in the HTML document.

<br><br>

## 24. Begins with Attribute Selector <a name = '24.begins-with-attribute-selector'></a>
The [attribute^=value] selector in CSS allows you to select elements that have an attribute value starting with a specific value. The ^= symbol is used to indicate that the attribute value starts with the specified value.

Here is an example of how you can use the [attribute^=value] selector in CSS:

```css
a[href^="https"] 
{
  background-color: yellow;
}
```
In this example, all \<a> elements with a href attribute value that starts with "https" will have a yellow background.

The [attribute^=value] selector is useful for selecting elements based on the starting characters of their attribute values. It is supported by all major browsers and is a useful tool for creating dynamic and interactive web pages.
<br><br>

## 25. Ends with Attribute Selector <a name = '25.ends-with-attribute-selector'></a>
The [attribute$=value] selector in CSS allows you to select elements that have an attribute value ending with a specific value. The $= symbol is used to indicate that the attribute value ends with the specified value.

Here is an example of how you can use the [attribute$=value] selector in CSS:

```css
img[src$=".jpg"] 
{
  border: 1px solid black;
}
```

In this example, all \<img> elements with a src attribute value that ends with ".jpg" will have a black border.

The [attribute$=value] selector is useful for selecting elements based on the ending characters of their attribute values. It is supported by all major browsers and is a useful tool for creating dynamic and interactive web pages.
<br><br>

## 26. Substring Attribute Selector <a name = '26.substring-attribute-selector'></a>
The [attribute*=value] selector in CSS allows you to select elements that have an attribute value containing a specific value. The *= symbol is used to indicate that the attribute value contains the specified value.

Here is an example of how you can use the [attribute*=value] selector in CSS:

```css
Copy code
a[href*="example"] 
{
  color: red;
}
```
In this example, all \<a> elements with a href attribute value that contains the word "example" will have red text.

The [attribute*=value] selector is useful for selecting elements based on the presence of a substring in their attribute values. It is supported by all major browsers and is a useful tool for creating dynamic and interactive web pages.
<br><br>



### CONCLUSIONS
 >While it's true that a small set of CSS selectors can go a long way, it's important to note that there are many more selectors available beyond the basics. Becoming familiar with the full range of selectors can be extremely useful when working on more complex projects, as it can give you more precision and control over the styles you apply to your HTML elements.
