# Intro to HTML and CSS

As we all know HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are the building blocks of the web. HTML provides the structure and content of a web page, while CSS is used to style and lay out the content. Here's a beginner's guide to help you get started with HTML and CSS:
<br>

# HTML 

Basic Structure: A basic HTML document consists of the following structure:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Your content goes here -->
  </body>
</html>
```
<br>

## Elements 
HTML consists of various elements, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, and more. To create an element, you wrap its content with an HTML tag. For example, to create a heading, you would use the \<h1> tag.
``` html
<h1>This is a Heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```
<br>

## Attributes
You can add additional information to an HTML element by using attributes. For example, to add a link to an element, you would use the href attribute on the \<a> tag.
``` html
<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example.com</a>
```
<br>

# CSS

**Styles**

CSS styles are used to change the appearance of HTML elements. Styles are defined using selectors and declarations. For example, to make all headings red, you would use the following code:

```css
h1 
{
  color: red;
}
```
<br>

## Selectors
Selectors are used to select the HTML elements that you want to style. You can select elements based on their tag name, class, or id. For example, to style all elements with a class of .highlight, you would use the following code:
```css
.highlight 
{
  background-color: yellow;
}
```

## Box Model
CSS works with a box model, which defines the space occupied by an HTML element as a rectangular box. The box consists of content, padding, borders, and margins. Understanding the box model is important for correctly positioning and sizing elements on a web page.

## Layout
CSS provides several layout models, such as the block and inline layout models, which determine how elements are displayed on the web page. You can also use CSS to create more complex layouts, such as grids and flexboxes.

These are just a few basics to get started with HTML and CSS. I recommend exploring more resources, such as tutorials and online courses, to deepen your understanding and improve your skills.
