# Naming Convensions

- Camel Case
- Snake Case
- Kebab Case
- Pascal Case

## What is Camel Case?
The resulting name starts with a lowercase letter, and each subsequent word in the name is capitalized, without any spaces or punctuation.

Here are some examples of camel case

**firstName and lastName.**

## What is Snake Case?
Like in camel case, you start the name with a small letter in snake case. If the name has multiple words, the later words will start with small letters and you use a underscore (_) to separate the words.

Here are some examples of snake case: first_name and last_name.

## What is Kebab Case?
Kebab case is similar to snake case, but you use a hyphen (-) instead of an underscore (_) to separate the words.

Here are some examples of kebab case: first-name and last-name.

## What is Pascal Case?
Unlike the previous examples, names in pascal case start with a capital letter. In case of the names with multiple words, all words will start with capital letters.

Here are some examples of pascal case: FirstName and LastName.
